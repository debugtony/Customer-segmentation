**Customer Segmentation Analysis Repository**

---

### Overview
This repository presents the results of a customer segmentation analysis conducted using KMeans clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The primary objective of this analysis is to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences by identifying distinct segments within the customer base.

### Contents
1. **Data**: Contains the datasets used for the analysis, including relevant customer data such as demographics, purchase history, and behavioral metrics.

2. **Scripts**: Includes Python scripts for data preprocessing, EDA, PCA, and KMeans clustering. These scripts provide the necessary code to perform the analysis.

3. **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks detailing the analysis process step-by-step. Notebooks cover EDA, PCA, KMeans clustering, and interpretation of results.

4. **Documentation**: Offers concise documentation on the methodology employed in the analysis, including explanations of PCA, KMeans, and their application to customer segmentation.

### Getting Started
To replicate or explore this analysis, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
